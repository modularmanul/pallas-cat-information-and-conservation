            This is a video about the Pallas's cat, featuring footage from the
            series "Frozen Planet II" by BBC.
          </div>
          <div class="fact-1">
            <h3>Discovery</h3>
            <p>
              The Pallas's cat was first described by the German naturalist
              Peter Simon Pallas in 1776, hence the name. He observed the
              species in Central Asia during his travels, where it was already
              known to locals, but it was new to the scientific community at the
              time.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="fact-2">
            <h3>Scientific Name</h3>
            <p>
              The Pallas's cat‚Äôs scientific name is Otocolobus manul.
              "Otocolobus" comes from Greek words meaning "straight ear,"
              referencing the unique shape of its ears, which are quite small
              and set wide apart.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="fact-3">
            <h3>Appearance</h3>
            <p>
              Pallas‚Äôs cat has a striking appearance with a dense, long fur coat
              that helps it survive in harsh, cold climates. Its fur is a mix of
              grey, yellow, and brown tones, and its large, round eyes give it a
              distinctive, ‚Äúgrumpy‚Äù expression.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="fact-4">
            <h3>Habitat</h3>
            <p>
              Pallas‚Äôs cat is native to the mountain steppes and grasslands of
              Central Asia, particularly in countries like Mongolia, Kazakhstan,
              and parts of China and Russia. It typically lives at altitudes
              between 1,000 and 5,000 meters (3,300 to 16,400 feet).
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="fact-5">
            <h3>Solitary and Shy</h3>
            <p>
              Unlike many other cats, Pallas's cats are solitary and tend to be
              very elusive. They prefer to stay out of sight, and their cryptic
              coloration helps them blend into rocky, grassy environments.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="fact-6">
            <h3>Diet</h3>
            <p>
              They are carnivores, primarily preying on small mammals like
              voles, pikas, and birds. They also sometimes hunt larger insects.
              Their hunting style is ambush-based, and they are not particularly
              fast runners but rely on stealth and patience.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="fact-7">
            <h3>Conservation Status</h3>
            <p>
              The Pallas‚Äôs cat is listed as "Near Threatened" on the IUCN Red
              List. Threats to its population include habitat loss, poaching for
              its fur, and competition with domestic animals for food. However,
              their elusive nature makes them difficult to study in the wild.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="fact-8">
            <h3>Interesting Fact</h3>
            <p>
              One of the most unique traits of the Pallas's cat is its extremely
              low metabolic rate. This helps it survive harsh environments by
              reducing its need for food. They are also adapted to withstand
              extreme temperatures, with fur that is even thicker in winter to
              keep them insulated.
